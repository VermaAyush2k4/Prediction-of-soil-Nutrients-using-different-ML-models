# Prediction-of-soil-Nutrients-using-different-ML-models

# Overview:

This project we are going to predict soil nutrients quantity of nitrogen,Phosphorus,Potassium in ppm with different machine Learning Models Like:

1)Decision Tree

2)Neural Networks(Deep learning)

3)K Nearest Neighbour

4)Random Forests

5)Xg Boost

User Interface design included which consists of taking features of soil from user and Out of 5 any 1 Model which helps to predict the quantity of nitrogen,Phosphorus,Potassium in ppm

Input design : files are : Output6 and Output7

Results : Files are : Output1,Output2,Output3,Output4,Output5
